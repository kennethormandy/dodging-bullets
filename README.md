# Dodging Bullets

A mobile-first approach to hanging bullets and ordinals for ordered and unordered lists.

To include it with your project, install Dodging Bullets through [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```
npm install --save dodging-bullets
```

…and then import it into your Sass files, depending on how you are including modules:

```scss
@import "./path/to/dodging-bullets/index.scss";
```

Note that Dodging Bullets doesn’t include any vendor prefixes by default.

Alternatively, and perhaps preferably, copy-and-paste the [Dodging Bullets `index.scss` file](index.scss) into your own project, as a starting point for your own list styles.

## TODO

- [ ] Add Sass variables for customisation
- [ ] Add more visually interesting examples
- [ ] Add test framework that will run from the CLI
